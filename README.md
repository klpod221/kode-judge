- üì¶ **Base64 Support** - Handle encoded source code and I/O
- üîÑ **Batch Operations** - Submit and retrieve multiple submissions at once
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Wait Mode** - Optional synchronous execution with immediate results
- üîç **Health Checks** - Comprehensive monitoring endpoints for all system components

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/klpod221/kode-judge.git
   cd kode-judge
   ```

2. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm server alembic upgrade head
   docker compose run --rm server python -m app.scripts.seed  # Seed initial data
   ```

4. **Access the API:**
   - API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
   - API Root: `http://localhost:8000`

### Configuration

Environment variables can be configured in `.env` file:

```env
# PostgreSQL
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=kode_judge
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PREFIX=kodejudge

# Worker
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=4  # Number of concurrent workers (default: 4)
```

## üìö API Usage

### Create a Submission

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/submissions/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_code": "print(\"Hello, World!\")",
    "language_id": 1,
    "stdin": ""
  }'
```

### Get Submission Result

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/submissions/{submission_id}"
```

### List All Languages

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/languages/"
```

### Health Check

```bash
# Overall health
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/"

# Database health
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/database"

# Redis health
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/redis"

# Workers health
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/workers"

# System information
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/info"

# Simple ping
curl "http://localhost:8000/health/ping"
```

### Batch Submissions

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/submissions/batch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {
      "source_code": "print(1 + 1)",
      "language_id": 1
    },
    {
      "source_code": "console.log(2 + 2)",
      "language_id": 2
    }
  ]'
```

For more examples, visit the interactive API documentation at `/docs`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Worker Configuration

### Adjusting Worker Concurrency

KodeJudge supports running multiple workers in parallel to handle high loads. Configure the number of workers using the `WORKER_CONCURRENCY` environment variable:

```env
# .env file
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=8  # Run 8 workers in parallel
```

**Default:** 4 workers

**Recommendations:**
- **Low traffic:** 2-4 workers
- **Medium traffic:** 4-8 workers
- **High traffic:** 8-16 workers
- **Resource consideration:** Each worker requires CPU and memory for code execution

### Monitoring Workers

Check worker status:
```bash
# View worker logs
docker-compose logs -f worker

# Check running workers
docker-compose exec worker rq info --url redis://queue:6379

# Health check via API
curl http://localhost:8000/health/workers
```

## üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

KodeJudge provides comprehensive health check endpoints for monitoring system status:

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Response |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `/health/` | Overall system health | Status of all components |
| `/health/database` | Database connectivity | Connection status & response time |
| `/health/redis` | Redis connectivity | Connection status & response time |
| `/health/workers` | Worker status | Queue size, worker count, failed jobs |
| `/health/info` | System information | Version, uptime, statistics |
| `/health/ping` | Simple availability check | Basic pong response |

### Health Status Values

- `healthy` - All systems operational
- `degraded` - System operational but with issues (high load, failed jobs)
- `unhealthy` - Critical component failure
- `no_workers` - No workers available to process submissions

### Worker Health Metrics

The `/health/workers` endpoint provides detailed metrics:

```json
{
  "queue_name": "kodejudge_submission_queue",
  "queue_size": 5,
  "workers_total": 4,
  "workers_busy": 2,
  "workers_idle": 2,
  "failed_jobs": 0,
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Integration with Monitoring Tools

Health check endpoints can be integrated with monitoring tools like:
- **Prometheus** - For metrics collection
- **Grafana** - For visualization
- **UptimeRobot** - For uptime monitoring
- **Datadog** - For comprehensive monitoring

Example Prometheus scrape config:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kodejudge'
    metrics_path: '/health/'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```
